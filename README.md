## About
Play this game using the buttons on screen, WASD or ↑ ← ↓ →

This is a snake game made with Phaser2 and I liked the build proces off it. It has 2 themes and all the art is created by my self as well.

When I was finsish with this version I found that it was better to use a 2d array. This is because you can have all the data saved in it: location, direction and sprite.
